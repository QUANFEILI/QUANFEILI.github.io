            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>Apple's website is known for its sleek design, intuitive navigation, and strong branding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Impressive colors. High contrast between text and background.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts and colors throughout.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are neatly aligned, creating a clean look.The text and images are balanced with each other, without any sense of difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The relevant content is well grouped and neatly formatted, making it easy for me to find where I need to go.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall,As an excellent benchmark for web design, Apple excels in all CRAP principles, contributing to an exceptional user experience. I love it!</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale Art</a></h3>
            <p>The Yale Art website suffers from poor design and usability, making navigation difficult.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> A sickening arrangement of colors. Low contrast in some areas makes it hard to read text.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The styles and fonts used in different parts are inconsistent, and some fonts are large or small, making it difficult to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The elements often appear misaligned, resulting in a chaotic appearance and causing the article and background to be mixed together in a disorderly and disorganized manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The relevant content is not effectively grouped, making user navigation complex and menu positions chaotic, making it difficult to find where I need to go.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This site fails to adhere to the CRAP principles, resulting in a frustrating user experience.</p>
